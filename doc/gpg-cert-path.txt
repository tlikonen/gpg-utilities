Usage: gpg-cert-path [options] [--] <from-key> <to-key>

Find the shortest certificate path(s) between two GnuPG keys. The output
is data for Graphviz which can draw an image of certificate path. Both
arguments must be 40-character key fingerprints.

Graphviz comes with tools like "dot", "neato", "fdp" etc. which
use different algorithms for drawing nodes and edges. Example:

    gpg-cert-path FROM-KEY TO-KEY | dot -Tpng > trust-path.png

Options:

  --fingerprint
        Print keys' full fingerprint.

  --all-user-ids
        Print all user ids.

  --max-steps=N
        Set the maximum certificate steps between keys to number
        N (positive integer). After that the search will give up. The
        default is 20.

  --invalid
        Include revoked keys, expired keys, revoked user ids, expired
        certificates and certificates for revoked user ids.

  -h, --help
        Print this help text.
