Usage: gpg-graph [options] [--] [key1 ...]

Find connections between GnuPG keys based on certificates (key
signatures) and output data for Graphviz which can draw a web of trust
image. The arguments can be any valid references to GnuPG keys. See
gpg(1) manual for help on that topic.

Graphviz comes with tools like "dot", "neato", "fdp" etc. which
use different algorithms for drawing nodes and edges. Example:

    gpg-graph ... | dot -Tpng > web-of-trust.png

Options:

  --fingerprint
        Print keys' full fingerprint.

  --all-user-ids
        Print all user ids.

  --two-way
        Print two-way arrows between cross-certified keys.

  --invalid
        Include revoked keys, expired keys, revoked user ids, expired
        certificates and certificates for revoked user ids.

  -h, --help
