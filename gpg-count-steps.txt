Usage: gpg-count-steps [options] [--] [from-key [to-key]]

Count the steps of the shortest certificate path between two keys in the
keyring. If no arguments are given test all keys between each other (can
take some time on large keyrings). If one key argument is given count
certificate steps from that key to all other keys. If two keys are given
count steps just between those keys. Both arguments, if given at all,
must be 40-character key fingerprints.

The output consists of lines with three fields:

 1. The fingerprint of the from key.
 2. The fingerprint of the to key.
 3. The number of steps between the keys (or "-" if connection wasn't
    found).

Options:

  --max-steps=N
        Set the maximum certificate steps between keys to number
        N (positive integer). After that the search will give up. The
        default is 20.

  --invalid
        Include revoked keys, expired keys, expired certificates and
        certificates for revoked user ids.

  -h, --help
        Print this help text.
